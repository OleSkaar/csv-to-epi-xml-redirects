A tool to convert a .csv file containing redirects to the XML format expected by the Episerver Redirect Manager.

To use the tool, create a list of redirects in a spreadsheet tool, where the first column is the link to be redirected from, and the second column is the link to be redirected to.

Then, upload the file here, and it will automatically convert it to the XML format expected by the Episerver Redirect Manager.

PS: The tool filters out any redirects that don't start with a slash followed by one or more characters. For example: /about-us/ is a valid url, but about-us/ is not.
